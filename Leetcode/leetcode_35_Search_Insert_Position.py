35. Search Insert Position
Solved
Easy

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found.
If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6,7], target = 2
Output: 1
(in while loop)
[1,3] left = 0, right = 1, middle = 0
nums[middle] = nums[0] = 1 < target, left = middle+1 = 1 = right
(in while loop)
[3] left = 1, right = 1, middle = 1
nums[middle] = nums[1] = 3 > target, right = middle-1 = 0 = left -1
(out of while loop)
return middle


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-104 <= target <= 104

We maintain:

left = the smallest index where target could possibly be inserted (lower bound).
right = the largest index where target could possibly be inserted (upper bound).

ðŸ”¹ When the loop ends

The loop stops when left > right.
At that exact point:
All indices < left hold values strictly less than target.
All indices > right hold values strictly greater than target.

And since right < left, thereâ€™s no gap left:
ðŸ‘‰ left is exactly the position where target belongs.
